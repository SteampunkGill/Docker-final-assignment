# This file overrides the base docker-compose.yml for the CI environment.

services:
  prometheus:
    # We redefine the prometheus service but OMIT the 'volumes' section
    # from the base docker-compose.yml.
    # When overriding, if a key is not present in the override file,
    # it means it's either kept from the base file (if not explicitly removed/overridden),
    # or in the case of lists/maps, it can be replaced or merged.
    # For 'volumes', providing an empty list explicitly replaces the original list.
    volumes: []
    # If there were other properties for prometheus in the base docker-compose.yml
    # that you wanted to keep (like image, ports, networks), you would NOT
    # redefine them here unless you wanted to change them.
    # However, to explicitly remove volumes, an empty list is the way to go.
